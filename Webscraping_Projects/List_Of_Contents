#Project Upwork 1
The idea comes from a job in upwork and basically what we need to do is scrape this website : https://www.xbrljordan.jo/iweb/index?guid=R8mWmn9N7rkWbrghZbYMn08pgMHg/p/Tvog646Vu6uwGz98ffv9c412fqYLFVtWqw0gUDwmRd565N%20QOJo7D3j3fp0Z19Yn1TaK4Mu5W3ys%3D
then from there the output that we need to get can be seen in the sample output xls project file in which we need to get all of the ouput example for each tickers.
